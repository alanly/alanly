# Loops Assignment #
> ## Overview ##
> This was a programming project that was developed in a group. It consists of choosing and utilizing the proper available Java loops as well as testing our abilities to code a proper algorithm.

> ## Program Narrative ##
> This program will generate and display a diamond formation made out of asterisk (`*`) characters based on a size specified by the user, which determines the height (number of rows) of the formation. This number is expected to be an odd integer within the range of 1 to 21 inclusive.

> The program generates the formation using two main for loops which individually handles the top and bottom half of the formation respectively. Two more for loops, which handle the printing of the space and asterisk characters, are nested in each of the two main loops. A third for loop, which is nestled between the two main loops, handles the output of the center row of asterisks which joins the two halves of the formation together.
